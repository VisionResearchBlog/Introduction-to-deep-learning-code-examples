# Examples from Eugene Charniak's Introduction to Deep Learning 2018 MIT Press

In 2019 I reviewed Eugene Charniak's book for the academic journal Perception
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006619857273?journalCode=peca

The book did not contain an online component and as part of the review I transcribed all
book examples included in the text.

Code examples chapter by chapter from Charniak's intro text

To run the code you will need to have python and the tensorflow library installed. The code
sections on reinforcement learning also require the Open.AI Gym library. Please note,
as sections are directly transribed from the text some .py files contain code snippets
and are not fully functioning programs. 

Code includes page numbers for where the examples can be located.
All code is more or less a direct transcription. There may be bugs in the code,
I added a few comments where helpful, or made small changes to correct typos or improve clarity.
but did not correct all errors.
