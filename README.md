Code examples chapter by chapter from Charniak's intro text

To run the code you will need to have python and the tensorflow library installed. The code
sections on reinforcement learning also require the Open.AI Gym library. Please note,
as sections are directly transribed from the text some .py files contain code snippets
and not fully functioning programs. Code includes page numbers for where the examples can be located.
All code is more or less a direct transcription (other than a few comments added or small
changes to correct typos or improve clarity).
